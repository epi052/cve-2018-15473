CVE-2018-15473
---
OpenSSH through 7.7 is prone to a user enumeration vulnerability due to not delaying bailout for an
invalid authenticating user until after the packet containing the request has been fully parsed, related to
auth2-gss.c, auth2-hostbased.c, and auth2-pubkey.c.

Install 
---
You may need to install your distro's equivalent `openssl-dev` package
```bash
# NOTE: if you're installing on kali, you can skip the pip install; paramiko is already there.  

git clone https://gitlab.com/epi052/cve-2018-15473.git
cd cve-2018-15473
pip install -r requirements.txt 
# - OR - 
pipenv install -r requirements.txt  # if you're cool like that   
chmod u+x ssh-username-enum.py
```
